# Static Comp Challenge 3

## **Specification**

#### The static comp 3 challenge is the last challenge of a series of three challenges to keep practicing HTML/CSS. This static comp was the most difficult by far. The content required for the HTML, CSS, and responsiveness were greater than the last two challenges. We were given the template to recreate with a few suggestions for features, and then we created out own verson of that template.


## **Base Requirements**

#### Basic static site setup with index.html and styles.css
#### Site must be responsive
#### Create a repo on github :octocat: for your work with following naming construct: [initials]-comp-challenge-[challenge number] (i.e. “bt-comp-challenge-1”)
#### Include a README with the repo that provides a brief overview of the project, and images of both the original comp and your version.
#### Push your final work to github pages
