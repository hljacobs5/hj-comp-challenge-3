# Static Comp Challenge 3

## **Specification**

#### The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. :muscle: You will be asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity. For each challenge, you’ll be given a static comp and asked to recreate it. Don’t worry, we’ll give you a bit of creative license, however the objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design. Once you get into the workforce - building out comps that reflect the designer’s choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is a requirement.

### **Things to Note**

#### They did not provide us with any assets, nor native files. We had to source assets on our own per the creative license guidelines below.

## **Creative License**

#### We could not take liberties with the layout, but our creative license included:

#### Copy
#### Images
#### Icons
#### Color palette, but ONLY if you select a complementary palette. We highly encourage you to visit sites like: material palette or coolors or color-hex.

## **Base Requirements**

#### Basic static site setup with index.html and styles.css
#### Site must be responsive
